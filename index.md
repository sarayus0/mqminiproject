<ins>Project Idea</ins>:<br>An interactive escape room where players have to use their knowledge on quantum gates to solve logic and probability problems. To "escape" each room, you have to transform a quantum state using allowed gates (like H, X, Z) so that it meets the puzzle's requirement. There are different types of puzzles including reaching a certain measurement probability, creating a target state, or creating entanglement. As you continue playing, and you "level up," the difficulty of the problems increase.

<ins>Project Goal</ins>:<br>The goal of this project is to create a simple, engaging visual representation of quantum problems, making them easier and fun to learn.

<ins>Background</ins>:<br>
**Motivation**
- To make quantum information science concepts easy to understand and memorable through games and hands-on learning. Introduce complex concepts simply. 
- To support all learners and learning styles by using visual and interactive teaching techniques
- To demonstrate how quantum logic can be applied beyond theory (in education, coding, and creative fields).
- To help fill the gap in interactive, puzzle-based resources and making quantum concepts more accessible.
