### Quantum Circuit Escape Room by Sarayu Sirikonda

*Project Idea:*
I will create an interactive escape room where players have to use their knowledge on quantum gates to solve logic and probability problems.To "escape" each room, you have to transform a quantum state using allowed gates (like H, X, Z) so that it meets the puzzle's requirement. There are different types of puzzles including reaching a certain measurement probability, creating a target state, or creating entanglement. As you continue playing, and you "level up," the difficulty of the problems increase

*Project Goal:*
The goal of this project is to create a simple, engaging visual representation of quantum problems, making them easier and fun to learn.
