Complex numbers are numbers with a *real component* and *imaginary component*, in the form \\(a+bi), where \\(a) and \\(b) are **real numbers** and \\(i) is the **imaginary unit**

An extended explanation of complex numbers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number)

It can be helpful to visualize complex numbers on the complex plane:

Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form as below:

To understand how the polar form is derived, check out this video:
